					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<p2>Work with a partner and experiment with loops.</p2>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p2>One major problem that I had was that my button function was not working when I pressed it
						and I found out that my input functions weren't written correctly, so JavaScript had no idea what to look for.
						It was mainly the IDs I gave my inputs that weren't corresponding to my javascript code, so I changed the IDs to match
						ones in my javascript file.
					</p2>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p2>I feel like this lab was a bit time consuming because I was having trouble with my button function not working and my HTML IDs not 
						lining up to my JavaScript ones. I was struggling a bit with this lab, but I eventually got the hang of it, credits to WesBot and Professor Modes' JavaScript
						for the help!
					</p2>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Here is the output of the js code. I'm very pround with the outcome.</p>
