					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
                    <p2>Some problems that I faces was that my console was showing some errors in my javascript, but it was
                        because I missed one entire line of code. So, when I added it, the console worked smoothly and my javascript
                        didn't show any errors
                    </p2>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
                    <p2>This assignment went by really smoothly as it was very straightforward and easy to understand. I feel like I put in some 
                        effort because I went back and looked at the lecture slides for examples.
