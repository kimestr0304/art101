			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding & Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<p2>Some challenges that we faced was constructing the author block in the javascript file. Both my partner and I were confused
						but we ended up asking WesBot and Chat GPT for help and we were able to understand what we were doing wrong.</p2>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p2>There weren't many problems that arose, but the most time consuming one was as I mentioned before, the author block, but we ended up solving it 
						by looking up examples and asking WesBot and Chat GPT for help.</p2>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p2>I believe that this assignment was done in a timely and smooth manner because I worked along side my partner and we
						asked each other for help and clearance. We were communicating in a effective and efficient manner which allowed us to work on it side by
						side. We both but the some extra effort as we were helping each other out, seeking outside help and examples, and confirming with one another about understanding the assignment. </p2>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<p2>This is the pseudocode for task #1 which is to select an everyday task and create a high-level tasks list, so we worked on create a lists of tasks for how to draw a chair.</p2>
					<pre><code>
						//Collect your materials
							//Sketch book, pens, pencils, erasers
						//Find your subject chair (can be any chair)
							//Position the chair in any way you like
							//Sunlight or artificial light can be hitting it, can be placed at an angle
						//Observe the chair
							//Pay attention to the chair’s design - the curves, the surface, and how much detail certain parts of the chair has
						//Create an outline sketch of the chair
							//Doesn’t have to be detailed, jot down main features, like the legs, base, and back
						//Shade in your sketch
							//Lightly shade the parts where the light hits the chair, but shade the shadows darker
						//Trace the outline of the chair with a pen (any pen)
						//You are done!
					</pre></code>

					<p2>This is the pseudocode for task #2 which was to select an online game and create a list of high-level tasks for the game we select and we went with Hang Man.</p2>
					<pre><code>
						//Chose the word
    						//Game selects random word that player needs to guess
						//Show the player the blanks
							//Let the player know how many blank spaces they need to fill in with a letter that corresponse to the word that was choosen
    						//Display a series of blank spaces representing each letter in the word
   							//Player will know how may letters in the word based on the number of blank spaces
							//Player guesses a letter
						//Check if the guess is correct
    						//If the guess is correct, the game reveals where the letter appear in the word
   							//If the guess is incorrect, the game counts it as wrong and updates a visual (drawing a part of the hangman)
						//Repeat until win or loss
    						//If player guesses all the letters in the word before making too many wrong guesses, they win
  							//If player makes too many wrong guessses (usually 6 wrong guesses will draw the full hangman), they lose the game
						//End Game
   							 //If player wins, the games shows a successs message
    						//If player loses, the games reveals the correct word
					</pre></code>
					<p2>This is a screenshot of how the pseudocode for Hang Man looks like in javascript.</p2>
