        <h1> Hello World</h1>

        <p> We are Kimberly and Trevor. Kimberly is a third year, majoring in Art and Design for Games and Playable Media.
            She decided to enroll in this ART 101 class as a way to understand the relationship between 
            technology and art on a more deeper level. Some of her hobbies are playing video games, drawing, and crocheting. Trevor is a 4th year 
            Art and Design: Games and Playable Media major. His hobbies and interests include: illustrating, cooking, and playing video games. He wanted 
            to take ART 101 because he was interested in web design.</p>
