					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<p2>Work with a partner and experiment with JS events and make sure that jQuery works.</p2>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p2>There wasn't any problems I ran into while doing this assignment. Everything was similar to the last lab we did
						so I had an easier time with this assignment.
					</p2>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p2>I felt like this assignment was very straightforward with the instructions, which made it really easy to follow along.
						I didn't put a lot of effort into this assignment like the previous one, but it was still fun to work on.
					</p2>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>What was the outcome of the lab?</p>
					<p2>I like how I was able to get the code to work at the end. Anyone can 
						type their name and get it sorted and also see an anagram of their name too.
						Try it out!
