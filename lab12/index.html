					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<p2>Work with a partner and create a function that depends on conditionals.</p2>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p2>The problems that I faced throughout the lab was that my array won't show up when I clicked the "Sort Me!" button. I 
						was trying to figure out what was going wrong, but when I used WesBot and Chat GPT, I learned that my functions were not properly
						linked to my button. So, I ended up fixing it and testing it and it finally worked. I liked how WesBot was very specific with how 
						my code was incorrect and it even provided me with a working and revised code, which I was thankful for. 
					</p2>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p2>I felt like this assignment was very straightforward, but there were some problems that I ran into. I still had fun with this lab, espcially
						when writting the traits of the Hogwarts' Houses.
