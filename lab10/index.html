					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p2>I felt like this assigment was straightforward with the instructions and the layout, which was very helpful. Throughout this 
						assignment, I felt like I put a decent amount of energy into this lab assigment, as I sought help from WesBot and edited my javascript code,
						to make sure that everything was working fine.
