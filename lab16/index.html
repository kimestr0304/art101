					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
                    <p2>I had problems coming up with the js code, I wasn't sure where to start, but thanks to WesBot and 
                        Chat GPT, I was able to get a head start. I also had trouble accessing the XKCP JSON link, it would say that I had to accessing it, but 
                        I realized that I had to get permission first from the orginal source, in order for the comics to load on my web page.
                    </p2>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
                    <p2>This assignment was a little hard to work with than the rest of the other labs, but I was able to seek help from WesBot and Chat GPT with my js 
                        so everything worked fine in the end. I put in a decent amount of energy in this assignment as I was looking for examples and ways to access the XKCP JSON code. 
                    </p2>
