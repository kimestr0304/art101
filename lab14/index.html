					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
                    <p2>It was a really straightforward and easy assignment. I did modify my homepage a bit more by adding more css and javascript functions.
                        I also added more images to my homepage to make it stand out more. This assignment was very easy to complete as I just used what I learned about 
                        css and javascript to improve my homepage.
                    </p2>

                <h2>Debugging</h2>
                <p>Explain how you improved your past files?</p>
                <p2>I added more css functions, such as different border styles and color. For the javascript I added a button that will change the appearance of the sections in my homepage. 
                    I also added a lot more images and used css to place them where I want them to be at. I made sure to go back and debug my code, so that the file can work without any problems. I feel like
                    I could do more with the javascript, but for now, I just wanted to add a "party" button.
                </p2>
                <p2>Here are the updated css and javascript codes. Javascript code is on the right and the CSS code is on the left. </p2>
