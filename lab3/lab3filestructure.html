        <h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
            <p>The purpose of this lab is to create a local file 
            structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>

            <h1>Challenges</h1>
            <p>It was a little difficult creating file structures, I wasn't sure 
            how one, but I was able to look up some examples and
            use them as a guide. So, I believe that I was able to pull it off. It was easy creating an index.html file and making it work as well.</p>
