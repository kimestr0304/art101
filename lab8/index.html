			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them?</p>
					<p2>I was having a hard time printing the results of my JavaScript on my 
						HTML, but I used WesBot for help and I managed to fix and run my code.

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment?</p> 
					<p2>I felt like this assignment was a little challenging because I still wasn't sure
						how to form an array correctly, but I managed to learn how because of Wesbot and the instructions on the lab.
