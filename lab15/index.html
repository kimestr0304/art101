					<h2>Challenge</h2>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p2>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p2>
					<p>For this assignment, I had hard time connecting the API of the website I wanted to work with. I had to ask Chat GPT for some help and I ended up successfully 
						linking the API. 
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p2>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p2>
					<p>I had fun with this assignment becuase I decided to fo with a pokemon API, which is something that was fun to do. I did have some problems, but I was able to 
						seek help from Chat GPT, which gave me revised versions of my javascript as I was unsure if I was doing it correctly. I feel like I put some-what a lot of
						energy into this assignment.
