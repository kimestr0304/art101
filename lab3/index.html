					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<p>Some challenges that I faced was creating the file strcutures. At first I was a bit confused, but after searching 
						up some examples, I was able to understand how to create the file structures.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>I had some difficultly putting my images on the code because the images would overlap with one another and they were too 
						big in size as well. Another thing was that I had some trouble with was uploading my images to V Studio, I wasn't understand how 
						to import images, but my partner ended up helping me out and showing me how to do it.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>I believe that this assignment went by smoothly, I did have some difficulties, but I ended up solving them with the help of my 
						partner and outside resources like Chat GPT and Wes Bot. I feel like I put a significant amount of energy into this assignment because 
						I want to play around with my code, especially my CSS code, in order to see how I can make my webpages stand out.
