					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
						<p>Some of the challenges I faced with this lab was having to set up the CSS code for the title page of the assignment and
						knowing which CSS selector, value, and property to use for specific parts of webpage.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them?</p>
						<p>Some of the main problems that arose was when working on this lab was mainly in the CSS code. I was having a hard
						time decorading my side of the website. I also was a little confused on how to start the code, but thankfully by
						partner was able to explain the steps and guide me in the steps I was having trouble with.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment?</p> 
						<p>I believe that this lab went by really smoothly especially because I was working side by side with my partner, so any 
						questions I had, my partner would explain the solutions. I feel like we both put in a lot of energy into this assignment 
						because we decided to meet up in-person and also communicate on Discord after and before class. </p>
